jira-heroes
===========

User
===========
Represents a single user on the JIRA system, points for Jira Heroes are accumulated at the user level and can be spent at the user's discretion.
A user can have multiple decks which are built by purchasing cards using story points.

Hero
===========
A deck is built for a specific hero where the cards should synergize the the hero's unique abilities.  There are currently 3 heroes planned for the initial launch:
1. Hacker
2. Engineer
3. Analyst
A hero has a special skill move that can be played much like a card only it is always available to the player. The objective of the game is to destroy your opponent's hero
before they destroy yours.

Deck
===========
A deck is owned by a user and it represents a collection of 30(?) cards and a hero.  Decks can be modified and enhanced by purchasing new cards using story points.

Campaign

Battle
===========
A battle is where all of the gameplay of Jira Heroes occurs.  A battle is between two decks (each with a hero) and is only complete once one player destroy's the other
player's hero.


Hero Classes
============

Architect
---------
??? This is a possible hero type that will not be in the initial release ???
Architects improve overall team synergy by giving overall guidance, this translates to major buffing for the team's abilities. Support class.

Hacker
---------
Hackers are fast, powerful, wreckless heroes that focus on dealing as much damage as possible.  Due to their wrecklessness they have a chance of damaging their own teammates, they are best paired with
a competent tester or other support class to mitigate the damage.

The hacker is like the rogue class, fast damage with overall high DPS.

Analyst
---------
Analyst is a support class focused on spell casting

Engineer
---------
Engineers have increased foresight and planning abilities, this means they may work slower than the hacker, but they produce realiable output.  They deal lots of damage, but at a slow rate.
They are careful not to harm their own teammates, unlike the hacker hero.

Engineers are equivalent to the mage class, with large damage bombs that take time to build.
